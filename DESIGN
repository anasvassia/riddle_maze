PyCharm does not support md documents

While starter.py might seem repetitive in that uimage and bimage have many of the same functions,
this was the only way for me to get the code to realize when the user and the maze were interaction
(such as when a user hits the wall)

In riddles.py / riddle_noClass.py, I used tkinter because originally, I was going to code my whole project
using tkinter. The riddles were the first things I coded, before I realized that pygame would be good to use.

For maze_game.py, please read through comments. As a quick summary, I first create my objects and then
in a while loop which runs while the user has not won (ie reached the bottom right hand corner) the user
is able to move.
